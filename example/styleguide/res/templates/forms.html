                <p>Tables in Open MCT are used to display data in a rows and columns format. There's no need to add any CSS classes to markup to effect the proper look, but be sure to use <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>'s in the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> section to get the proper look.</p>
                <p>We recommend using class <code>numeric</code> in columns that display numbers: this class right-aligns the text and allows numbers to be compared more easily.</p>
