# API

This directory is for draft API documentation and design.  The API is organized into a few major components, which are documented in their own READMEs.  See the following:

* Domain Objects
    Capabilities
    Events
    Mutation
    Etc

* [Object API](object-api/README.md) (encapsulates persistence), should include roots
* [Region API](region-api/README.md) 
* [Telemetry API](telemetry-api/README.md)
* [Type API](type-api/README.md)

Not yet started:

* [Action API](action-api/README.md)
* [Indicators API](indicators-api/README.md) -- potentially compress into regions?
* [Plugin API](plugin-api/README.md)
