                <ul>
                    <li>ID and class names should be human-readable: use names that are as short as possible while long enough to be meaningful. Ideally, names are semantic to the purpose of the element. Avoid names that don't convey meaning.</li>
                    <li>Avoid class names that refer overtly to the presentation of an object (e.g. <code>.red</code>) - this strategy is brittle and doesn't allow for themeing.</li>
                    <li>Generic names may be used for classes that serve as &quot;helpers&quot; such as <code>.alt</code>.</li>
